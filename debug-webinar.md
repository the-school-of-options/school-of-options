# Webinar Debug Information

## Current Issue
Error Code 3706: "The meeting number is wrong"

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Webinar Data**: Look at the console log for "Joining webinar with data:" to see the full webinar object
2. **Verify Meeting Number**: The meeting number `84420553813` needs to be verified
3. **Check Webinar Status**: Ensure the webinar is currently live/active

## Common Causes of Error 3706

1. **Webinar vs Meeting**: The ID might be a webinar ID but needs to be treated as a meeting
2. **Webinar Not Started**: The webinar might not be currently active
3. **Wrong ID Format**: The ID format might need adjustment
4. **Webinar Ended**: The webinar might have already ended

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Use Meeting SDK for Webinars
Some webinars need to be joined as meetings rather than webinars.

### Option 2: Check Webinar Status First
Verify the webinar is active before attempting to join.

### Option 3: Use Different Join Method
Try using the full join URL instead of just the meeting number.

## Test Cases to Try

1. **Direct Meeting Number**: `84420553813`
2. **With Join URL**: If you have the full Zoom join URL
3. **Different Role**: Try role 1 (host) vs role 0 (attendee)

## Next Steps

1. Check the console logs for the full webinar data
2. Verify the webinar is currently active in Zoom
3. Try using the join_url if available instead of just the ID
