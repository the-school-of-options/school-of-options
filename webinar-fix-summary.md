# Webinar Join Fix - Based on Zoom Meeting SDK Documentation

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Join Parameters (Critical)
- **Added mandatory `userEmail`**: According to Zoom docs, this is required for webinars
- **Changed `password` to `passWord`**: Using correct parameter name per SDK docs
- **Removed `sdkKey` and `role`**: These shouldn't be in join params for embedded SDK
- **Ensured meeting number consistency**: Same number used in signature and join

### 2. Enhanced Signature Generation
- **Added meeting number (`mn`) to JWT payload**: Ensures signature matches join request
- **Added role to JWT payload**: Proper role specification in signature
- **Added debug logging**: To verify signature generation parameters

### 3. Improved SDK Initialization
- **Added `patchJsMedia: true`**: Better compatibility for webinars
- **Enhanced validation**: Check required parameters before attempting join

### 4. Better Error Handling
- **Specific webinar error codes**: Handle 3706, 3707, 3708, 3709 with meaningful messages
- **Parameter validation**: Ensure all required fields are present

## What to Test Now

1. **Check the new debug logs**:
   - Look for "Generating signature with payload" in server logs
   - Check "Join parameters" in browser console
   - Verify meeting number consistency

2. **Expected behavior**:
   - Should see more detailed parameter logging
   - Error messages should be more specific
   - Join should work if webinar is active and parameters are correct

## Common Issues & Solutions

### If Error 3706 Persists:
1. **Webinar not started**: Check if webinar is actually live
2. **Wrong meeting type**: Might need to use regular meeting join instead
3. **Registration required**: Some webinars require pre-registration

### If Error 3707 (Password):
- Check if password is correctly extracted from join URL
- Verify password format and encoding

### If Error 3708 (Not Started):
- Webinar hasn't started yet or has ended
- Check webinar schedule and status

## Next Steps

1. Try joining the webinar again
2. Check both browser console and server logs
3. If still failing, we may need to:
   - Use the regular Meeting SDK instead of embedded
   - Check if webinar requires registration
   - Verify webinar is actually live and accepting participants
